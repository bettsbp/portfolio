        <h1>About Me:</h1>
        <p>My name is Brandon and I'm very excited about all this coding and programming business. There are a couple things I'm nervous about, but hopefully that won't be much of a problem.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Outside of this new career path I am chasing, I love to play video games, be outside, and be with friends. Although, most of the time I like to sit alone. Some people would call me quite strange, but that's okay. I kind of do it on purpose to get reactions out of people or to try and brighten up their day. Even if I'm having a bad day, it doesn't that others have to as well.</p>

            <div class="row>">
              <div class="col-md-6">
                <p>My name is <strong>Brandon</strong> and I'm <em>very</em> excited about all this coding and programming business. There are a couple things I'm nervous about, but hopefully that won't be much of a problem.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="col-md-6">
                <p>I was born in Vietnam and was almost immediately taken to an orphanage. I never knew my birth parents and I doubt I ever will, but that's okay because I love my family here and I'm glad they chose me. I've lived in a city called West Linn just a little ways away from Portland my entire life.</p>
              </div>
              <p>Before applying to this class I was pretty unsure of what I wanted to do with my life, you know, the usual "Oh no what am I going to do out of high school" kind of thing. It's a bit depressing to talk about, but I was in a bad place. <strong><em>ANYWAY,</em></strong> I took a couple coding classes in high school which all kind of glossed over the basics of html, css, javascript and a couple other things I don't remember anymore. Unfortunately, almost everything I learned in those classes I've purged from my memory. I wasn't too crazy about the idea of a four year degree college or a 'typical' career path. For the longest time, actually, my goal was to be a professional gamer! <em><span>It's kind of weird, I know</span></em>, but I did get pretty good. However, I'm now seeking a career where my chances of success are much greater and I can focus more on my skills rather than getting lucky.</p>
            </div>
            <br>
            <p>Outside of this new career path I am chasing, here are some things that I enjoy doing in my free time <span>(which I don't have much of anymore unfortunately)</span>.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Making music</li>
            <li>Listening to good music</li>
            <li>Playing Video Games</li>
            <li>Hanging out with friends</li>
            <li>Reading books</li>
            <li>Going for long walks outside</li>
            <li>Walking through natural places</li>
          </ul>
          <p>I absolutely <strong>LOVE</strong> music and everything about it. I love making it, listening to it, reading it, watching analysis videos about arrangements, etc. There's almost nothing I don't like about it except maybe when people trash on other people's musical opinions. Right now, I'm a bit obsessed with a musical group called <a href="http://www.ptxofficial.com/"<em>Pentatonix</em></a>. I just love that they're all a capella and how clever they are with their arrangements. I linked my favorite piece by them in the piano image at the top of the page if you want to check it out.</p>
          <p>There are a couple things that I hope to accomplish throughout the duration of this class:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Get a new career in the tech industry</li>
            <li>Prove to myself that I can accomplish things if I set my mind to it</li>
            <li>Not fail</li>
            <li>Have fun</li>
          </ol>
